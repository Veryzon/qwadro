# The Qwadro Execution Ecosystem
Qwadro is an open standard level-3 system infrastructure, ISO C17 data-oriented low-level execution ecosystem that offers a set of acceleration building blocks to build system softwares that targets computer simulations and multimedia user experiences. It is a coalition of middlewares, libraries, drivers and engines which are released as open source under the Qwadro License.

The API concept and specification proposed in this project were primarily contributed by Veryzon. They were drafted in large part by Veryzon and owe much in their form and format to Veryzon's experimental technologies. The Working Group process provided advice, comments, guidance and suggestions for additions to these guidelines, which were contributed by software developers with battle-tested experiences working with RenderWare, OpenGL and Vulkan graphics hardware and software vendors and application developers and enthusiasts, indie game developers and enthusiasts, game modding communities and enthusiasts, come from backgrounds like Republica SIGMA, SIGMA Technology Group, SIGMA FEDERATION, Scitech, Engitech, NVIDIA, TVE, Bellas Arts, Criterion Software, EA Technology, Ensemble Studios, Telekinesys and Intel. Just to quote some of them.

The SIGMA FEDERATION and all members shall not be held liable to any person or entity for any reason related to the adoption or implementation of, nor adherence to the recommendations in, nor any other use of this project nor any accompanying software.

## Introduction
This project represents the work of a group of 3D hardware and software vendors and application developers meeting as the Qwadro Working Group (4DWG) of the SIGMA Technology Group of the SIGMA FEDERATION, the federation of independent cyber science, technology and engineering, cybercultist and technocratic societies from Latin America. The goal of the group is to influence, foster, viabilize and improve the genuine development of multimedia user experience applications, hardware-accelerated high-performance optimal softwares and optimal entertainment softwares in the areas of 2D, 3D and 4D simulations and its renderization for the Latin American audience.
This project defines the expectations of the group with regards to current acceptable 4D simulation and rendering functionality, and is an extension to the work done by Veryzon known as Quadridimensional World Approximation.

Qwadro is not a game engine. Why is Qwadro not a game engine? Because the Qwadro ecosystem was initially made to run demoscenes, mainly from RenderWare, but not limited to them, and then to be necessarily customized, always creating different products, as in-house game engines were made in the past, when everything seemed to be distinguishable and was made using a custom technology.

Despite little current similarity, the Qwadro's embryo emerged from the RenderWare Platform and Havok Physics in an attempt to rebuild the demos in a truly multithreaded paradigm and OpenGL.
After certain maneuvers, RenderWare proved to be very inefficient on new hardware, that is, certain procedures could be better optimized for current hardware capabilities at the same or lower computational cost. The API and general code design was inspired by Havok Physics and, mainly the object model, by Qt Framework, in addition to preserving some semantics remaining from RenderWare.

Currently, Qwadro constitutes a collection of middlewares integrating systems, subsystems and drivers, abstracting operating systems and platforms.

Despite the name, the codebase prefix (in C, equivalent to the namespace in C++) is AFX. There are other prefixes for other partitions (AVX, AEX, AAX, AMX, AUX, ATX, etc). The SIGMA reserves for itself and its experiments every possible prefix A\*X for official expansions of the Qwadro.

There are several strange names in Qwadro, because Qwadro is an experiment that implements several paradigms of the same concept with random names to test both in parallel, and its API changes frequently depending on usage optimization. And... it is governed by methodist laws of Go Horse.
There is some RenderWare semantics heritage still present. For example, we have afxRaster, afxQuat, afxV3d, afxV4d.

Qwadro was firstly designed for POSIX/Unix/Linux systems. Due to complexities handling multiple OpenGL contexts in Windows, we were forced to move to Windows and stay there still now.

About code generation, Qwadro codebase was written for compilation in LLVM/Clang. No other toolset was tested except MSVC (and worked when so), which is not officially supported due to it have never been a real C compiler but a C++ compiler. Qwadro also doesn't use CMake because the main developer had problems (and laziness) with Visual Studio 2017, the IDE used to code the Qwadro.

Game-related works featured in Qwadro are strongely inspired in notorious gaming works on Bang! Engine by Ensemble Studios and MaxFX by Remedy Entertainment.

## The Qwadro Video Graphics Infrastructure
SIGMA GL/2 (aka SGL, SIGGL) is an data-oriented API specification where the common things are (relatively) easy, and the super powerful low-level optimizations are optional. This new API was firstly idealized to be easy as OpenGL but still trying to be powerful close to Vulkan, Direct3D e Metal. Unlike other low-level APIs, SIGMA G/2 follows a rapid application development (RAD) philosophy, where it delivers several utilities to speed up and automate operations, still allowing the user to do it their own way if they want.

The first (standard) implementation of SIGMA GL/2 is strongely inspired on paradigms of that was supposed to be OpenGL 5.
This is an effort by SIGMA to offer a high-performance real-time 3D drawing API. SIGMA chose a different approach with SIGMA GL/2: introducing its own abstractions and not directly mirroring any of today's native APIs. One reason is because no single API is available on all systems, and also because many concepts (such as extremely low-level memory handling) are not idiomatic to users not accustomed to the heat of metal.
Although certain features inherited from 3dfx Voodoo APIs, they have been reworked to look more like Vulkan. And also most of the dialect of SIGMA GL/2 is inherited from the OpenGL/Vulkan side of the force, becoming the purple side of the force; (blue + red).

An example of abstraction in SIGMA GL/2 is the lack of an object known as a "framebuffer". The framebuffer is a problematic name for its concept of operation where there is no actual buffer and it was a name inherited from the hardware. Due to this, in Qwadro, its pseudo-equivalent is a "canvas", which is an object that handles an arrangement of surfaces, capable of being bound with rasters (de facto, the buffer), where a drawing is made.

The idea behind its proposal was the development overhead of Vulkan API being absolutely insane when we tried to move from OpenGL to Vulkan in our recent works.
There were several helper functions to produce a minimalist usable library that made Vulkan a lot productive, which became effectily an other middleware.
After several deployments in Vulkan, the SIGMA Technology Group, pushed by graphics programming community, started development a new API: the purple side of the force.
But don't think we are just creating a wrapper around them.


In SIGMA GL/2, devices are firstly virtual. You probably will not seen the name of your GPU there, but a custom name. Wrappers broken the concept of handling a real device, so we adopted it as a fact.

Draw I/O System is a modulation of Qwadro Execution Ecosystem, also developed by SIGMA, effectively a try to implement the SIGMA GL/2 API specification. You can install custom device drivers in Qwadro, like in early days of computer graphics where you could download and install device drivers directly in root directory of your application.
These custom device drivers obviously will be wrappers. But you can write your own so no relying on the only driver to X platform or Y API. Could have even drivers using combined physical devices at once.

As aforementioned, SIGMA GL/2 works on the "bring your own driver" model. Seeing Vulkan, OpenGL's successor, suffer from the same problems that OpenGL suffered in the past when platform holders did not want to have such an API, SIGMA chose to replicate a model from the ancient times of hardware-accelerated computer graphics, where people looked for better driver implementations, including those based on existing common APIs or APIs specific to the installed VGA; the installable client driver (ICD) or, its more minimalist version, the mini client driver (MCD).

Why custom device drivers? Well. You see. Vulkan started suffering of same issues than OpenGL suffered in past. Vulkan runs over wrappers in Metal, for example. For presentation, Vulkan relies on Direct3D 12 swapchains on Windows. Old APIs such as Direct3D 9 and OpenGL also runs over wrappers in some recent versions of some IHV drivers. WebGL (almost unnecessarily) runs over wrappers. WebGPU runs over wrappers. These wrappers seems several bugs and issues due to IHVs being negligent. In the end, almost everything will run in wrappers.

SIGMA GL/2 tried and will keep trying to match the OpenGL conventions or, when not existing, the Vulkan conventions. The default pixel format will probably be ARGB (as known in LE as, BGRA) why it is faster. And the image data origin will continue to be left-bottom-near (even it being weird for work in screen space ops) why it makes sense going up in positive Y and right in positive X and far in negative Z, preserving consistence to the right-handed coordinate system. Also, in SIGMA GL/2, the triangle front facing is counter-clockwise (CCW).

Despite driver implementation, Qwadro uses extended OpenGL Shading Language (GLSL) as native shading language.

## The Qwadro Accoustic Infrastructure
SIGMA A4D is an API for rendering accoustic simulations inspired on Miles Sound System way of handling several applicable service interfaces.

Instead of just offer another API, the SIGMA proposal is to allow you to run other middlewares using same interface. But it is in phase of decisions for its basic foundation, mainly due to Microsoft have killed hardware acceleration for audio since Windows Vista.

## The Qwadro Simulation Infrastructure
The quadridimensional world approximation extensions.

Before Qwadro become an whole execution ecosystem, it was an old project experimenting with what a simulation would be like where time-space (see, time over space) were manipulated in unconventional ways. From there became its name, which is an acronym for Tetradimensional/Quadridimensional World Approximation.
The old project was a experiment to test the possibility of our real world be in fact some type of simulation. We discovered interesting things about the "behavior and fabric of the reality", but it is too complex concept to explain.

Such as RenderWare, Qwadro forces the use of the so-called "right-handed coordination system", where positive X advances to right, positive Y advances to up and positive Z advances to front.

In Qwadro, a matrix is neither row-major nor column-major. Their matrices are hybrids. The upper 3x3 submatrix (where linear operations occur) is column-major, while the translation set is row-major. Yes, that madness there. Different from what you will expect in the war of row-major (Direct3D) vs. column-major (OpenGL). Qwadro is the definitive supremacy.

This is a complicated approach because it mixes both OpenGL and Direct3D concepts, functions, and operations at the same time. Writing AMX was hell because of this, and not all functions have been tested yet.

Several parts of simulators in Qwadro is inspired in Bang! Engine (Age Of Empires III engineering) and MaxFX 2.0 (Max Payne 2 engineering) in how to handle assets.

A Qwadro Simulation works on the "bring your own driver" model. Driver? Yes. You can install a custom device driver to run your simulation. 
It allow you to change physics engines and sample animations in GPU pipelines with OpenGL, Vulkan, OpenCL, CUDA, DSPs, SPUs or other coprocessors.
This is why we don't have SIMD methods for math (at least yet); you can install a hardware-accelerated physics engine.
